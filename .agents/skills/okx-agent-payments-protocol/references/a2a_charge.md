# a2a_charge — agent-to-agent payment links (`onchainos payment a2a-pay`)

> Loaded from `../SKILL.md` when the user mentions a paymentId, an `a2a_...` link, "create payment link", or asks to check a2a payment status. Unlike the HTTP 402 paths (`accepts`-based and `WWW-Authenticate: Payment`), a2a is **not triggered by an HTTP 402 response** — it's invoked by name, with a paymentId or a seller's create-link request.

Wraps `onchainos payment a2a-pay` end-to-end for both seller and buyer roles. Buyer-side trust is **delegated to the upstream caller** — when invoked with a `paymentId`, the skill fetches the on-server challenge, TEE-signs it as-is, submits the credential, and auto-polls payment status to a terminal state.

## Pre-flight

Both seller (`create`) and buyer (`pay`) require an authenticated wallet session. Before invoking either:

```bash
onchainos wallet status
```

- **Logged in** → proceed.
- **Not logged in** → ask the user to log in via `onchainos wallet login` (AK login, no email) or `onchainos wallet login <email>` (OTP login). **Do NOT attempt to sign without a live session.**

`status` does not require additional pre-flight beyond what the CLI itself enforces.

## Seller — Create a Payment Link

**Inputs**:
- **Required**: `--amount` (decimal, e.g. `"0.01"`), `--symbol` (e.g. `"USDT"`), `--recipient` (0x... EVM address — seller wallet)
- **Optional**: `--description`, `--realm`, `--expires-in` (seconds, default 1800)

**Steps**:

1. Run pre-flight (see above).
2. Shell out:
   ```bash
   onchainos payment a2a-pay create \
     --amount <amount> --symbol <symbol> --recipient <recipient> \
     [--description <text> --realm <domain> --expires-in <seconds>]
   ```
3. Parse the response — only `payment_id` and `deliveries.url` (optional) are present. The CLI no longer returns `amount` / `currency`; echo the seller's input args back for display.
4. Display:

   > Payment link created.
   > • paymentId: `<id>`
   > • Amount: `<amount input> <symbol input>` (decimal as you submitted)
   > • Recipient: `<recipient input>`
   > • Share with buyer: `<deliveries.url>` (if returned by the server) or `paymentId=<id>`

5. Suggest next: poll status anytime with `onchainos payment a2a-pay status --payment-id <id>` once the buyer is expected to have paid.

## Buyer — Pay a Payment Link

**Required input**: `paymentId` only. The CLI fetches the seller-issued challenge from the server and signs whatever amount / currency / recipient the challenge declares.

> **Trust model**: the buyer signs the seller's challenge as-is. Verifying that the challenge matches what the buyer agreed to pay is the **upstream caller's responsibility** — the user (or the upstream skill) MUST cross-check the seller's `paymentId` / `deliveries.url` against their out-of-band agreement (chat, task spec, prior negotiation) **before** calling this skill. Once invoked, the skill signs whatever the on-server challenge declares.

### Step 1 — Sign and submit

The skill does not run its own preview / yes-no gate; trust is delegated upstream. Shell out directly:

```bash
onchainos payment a2a-pay pay --payment-id <paymentId>
```

The CLI fetches the on-server challenge, TEE-signs the EIP-3009 authorization, and submits the credential. The successful response shape:

```json
{
  "payment_id":   "a2a_xxx",
  "status":       "<status>",
  "tx_hash":      "<hash or null>",
  "valid_after":  0,
  "valid_before": 1746000000,
  "signature":    "0x..."
}
```

### Step 2 — Auto-poll status to terminal

Status classification:

- **Non-terminal** (poll): `pending`, `settling`
- **Terminal** (stop): `completed`, `failed`, `expired`, `cancelled`

If `status` is already terminal → render the result and stop.

If non-terminal → poll every **3 seconds**, up to a **60-second** total budget:

```bash
onchainos payment a2a-pay status --payment-id <paymentId>
```

- As soon as a terminal status is observed → render full result (status + tx_hash + block_number) and stop.
- If 60 seconds elapse and the status is still non-terminal → return the current `status` plus the paymentId, and tell the user: "Status is still `<status>` after 60s; you can run `status` again later."

**Terminal display strings**:

| status | Display |
|---|---|
| `completed` | "✅ Payment confirmed on-chain. tx_hash: `<tx_hash>` block: `<block_number>`" |
| `failed` | "❌ Payment failed. (include the server-provided reason if any)" |
| `expired` | "⌛ Payment link expired before settlement. Ask the seller for a new one." |
| `cancelled` | "🚫 Seller cancelled this payment." |

---

## Status — Query Payment State

**Input**: `paymentId`.

```bash
onchainos payment a2a-pay status --payment-id <paymentId>
```

Map the returned `status` to a human-readable line:

| status | Meaning | Display |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | Awaiting buyer signature | "⏳ Awaiting buyer signature." |
| `settling` | Credential received, settling on-chain | "🔄 Settling on-chain (credential submitted, awaiting confirmation)." |
| `completed` | Confirmed on-chain | "✅ Confirmed on-chain. tx_hash: `<tx_hash>` block: `<block_number>` fee: `<fee_decimal> <fee_symbol>`" |
| `failed` | Payment failed | "❌ Failed. (include the server-provided reason if any)" |
| `expired` | Expired before settlement | "⌛ Expired before settlement." |
| `cancelled` | Seller cancelled | "🚫 Cancelled by seller." |

**Rendering the fee**: the CLI returns `fee_amount` as a top-level string in minimal units (and `fee_bps` as the basis-points used). To compute `<fee_decimal>`, look up the token decimals (see Amount Display Rules below). For `<fee_symbol>`, reuse the `--symbol` the seller passed to `create` for the same `paymentId` — the upstream caller (or the seller flow that issued the link) is the source of truth; the `status` response itself does not echo it back. If neither is available, display `fee_amount` minimal units as-is.

**Suggest next**:
- `pending` / `settling` → "Check again in a few moments" or wait briefly and re-run `status`.
- `completed` → recommend `okx-agentic-wallet` to verify post-payment balance delta.
- `failed` → recommend checking buyer balance via `okx-agentic-wallet`, and if `tx_hash` is present, inspect it via `okx-security tx-scan`.

## Cross-skill workflows

### Workflow A — Sub-skill called from an upstream agent flow (most common)

Applicable upstream callers: any agent-to-agent task / chat / agent flow that holds the seller-issued payment information.

**Contract — upstream MUST hand off `paymentId`** (this reference stops and asks the user if missing). Upstream is also responsible for confirming, before invoking, that the `paymentId` matches the buyer's agreed terms.

```
1. <upstream caller>     verifies paymentId matches the buyer's agreed terms → hands off paymentId
       ↓
2. okx-agent-payments-protocol (a2a_charge)   onchainos payment a2a-pay pay → auto-poll status → display terminal
       ↓
3. okx-agentic-wallet    optional: onchainos wallet balance to see post-payment delta
```

### Workflow B — Seller manually creates a payment link

```
1. okx-agent-payments-protocol (a2a_charge create)   → paymentId + deliveries.url
2. Seller shares paymentId (and optionally deliveries.url) with the buyer out-of-band
3. Buyer cross-checks the paymentId / deliveries.url against the seller's quoted terms, then runs Workflow A starting from step 2
```

### Workflow C — Payment failure triage

```
1. okx-agent-payments-protocol (a2a_charge status)   → expired / failed / cancelled
2. Branch on terminal state:
   - expired   → ask seller to create a new link
   - failed    → check buyer balance via okx-agentic-wallet; inspect tx_hash via okx-security tx-scan if present
   - cancelled → contact seller out-of-band
```

## Upstream Routing — Avoiding `create` Loops

This reference is stateless per call and has no view of the conversation. If the upstream seller agent routes by surface keywords alone (e.g. matches `付款` / `pay` / `payment` and always calls `create`), it will loop:

```
buyer: "I want to pay"        → seller create → returns paymentId_A
buyer pays via this skill, then sends:
buyer: "payment successful"   → seller matches "payment" → create AGAIN → paymentId_B (wrong)
```

The fix lives in the upstream caller's intent router. When wiring this reference into a seller-side agent, enforce before calling `create`:

1. **Detect existing paymentId in the incoming message.** If the buyer's message contains an `a2a_...` id (or a `deliveries.url` you previously issued), route to `status` for that id. Do NOT call `create`.
2. **Disambiguate intent beyond keywords.**

| Buyer says | Intent | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| "I want to pay" / "请付款" / "怎么付" / "give me a link" | request-invoice | `create` |
| "paid" / "payment successful" / "已付" / "已转账" / contains paymentId or tx hash | payment-receipt | `status` (or no-op if terminal) |
| "cancel" / "refund" | cancel/refund | out of scope |

3. **Track per-conversation order state upstream.** Once `create` issues a paymentId for a given (buyer, order) context, the upstream agent must remember that paymentId and mark the order as "awaiting payment". Subsequent buyer messages in that context default to `status` against the remembered paymentId until the payment reaches terminal or the user explicitly asks for a new order.
4. **Idempotency on `create`.** Before issuing a new `create`, the upstream agent must check its own state: if a non-terminal paymentId already exists for the same buyer / order context, reuse it instead of creating a new one.

This guidance is advisory for upstream agent authors — this reference itself will execute whichever command you call.

## Amount Display Rules

Convert `amount` / `fee_amount` from minimal units using the hardcoded decimals table:

| Token | Decimals | "1000000" minimal renders as |
|---|---|---|
| USDC | 6 | 1.00 USDC |
| USDT | 6 | 1.00 USDT |
| USDG | 6 | 1.00 USDG |
| ETH | 18 | (`1e18` minimal = 1.00 ETH) |

For any symbol not in the table: render `<minimal> <symbol>` and append `unknown decimals — please double-check the seller-provided amount`. **Do not block** the flow.

---

## Edge cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|---|---|
| `onchainos wallet status` reports not logged in | Prompt user to run `onchainos wallet login`. Never attempt to sign without a live session. |
| User provides no `paymentId` | STOP and ask the user for the seller-issued paymentId. |
| CLI reports `payment ... not payable` / expired challenge / unsupported intent | Relay the error verbatim and surface as a **terminal failure** — do NOT retry signing. |
| `paymentId` not found / 404 from server | Relay the error and ask the user to confirm the paymentId with the seller or upstream caller. |
| `pay` succeeded but status still `pending` / `settling` after 60s poll budget | Return the current status verbatim + paymentId; tell the user `Status is still <status> after 60s; you can run status again later`. |
| Server returns 5xx | Surface status code and any `errorMessage` verbatim. **Do not auto-retry `pay`** — every retry produces a fresh EIP-3009 nonce + signature; let the upstream decide. `status` is read-only and safe to retry manually. |
| `--symbol` is not in the hardcoded decimals table | Apply the unknown-decimals fallback (see Amount Display Rules). Do not block. |
| `--expires-in` was set too short and the link is now past its window | `status` returns `expired`; ask the seller to create a new link. |
